	Ford Motor Co said it extended its buyer incentive program on light trucks to April 30 from April 6, the programs previous expiration date. Ford, which saw a 23 pct rise in its March truck sales over the March 1986 level, said the incentives were extended to maintain its truck sales momentum. The program itself was not changed. Customers have a choice of 3.9 to 9.9 annual percentage rate financing or a cash rebate of 300 dlrs or 600 dlrs, depending on the type of transmission chosen. Ford last week extended to April 30 from March 12 its incentive program on its compact trucks and the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars.
